It's very fustrating as there's a lot of role confusion.
Producables are fine as is.
MapLoader states needs to be redone: that is it should act as a factory for
regions.
This isn't the first time I've had to do a big overhaul.
I think refactoring region stuff should be the easiest first step (though still
not easy).
