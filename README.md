# Dumb 3D Project
I'm just dumping this online, for backup/version control purposes. It's GPLv3.
If you find use for any of this, great. This is not intended as a readable/
usable project. It's just for fun. n.n

# WebGL Port? \[2022-0903\]
Well, it exists. Just expect it to be a little buggy.
Test cases will have to wait for now. Once I've some idea on *how* to write cases for something like this. Anyway I wanted this posted to show a friend. I in know way believe this to be "ready to ship", and I don't want to leave that impression for any reader.

## Current "tickets"
- sweeps for collisions driver
- simplify Platform to a single class
- clean up tile factory stuff
- proper map loader
