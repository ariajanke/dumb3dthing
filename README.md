# Dumb 3D Project
I'm just dumping this online, for backup/version control purposes. It's GPLv3.
If you find use for any of this, great. This is not intended as a readable/
usable project. It's just for fun. n.n

## Development Status
This project is currently in a non-demonstrable state. Presently there are no
plans for it to ever be in a demostrable condition.

## Planned Features
- loop-de-loops
- water
- other game entities
- other game play goodies
- other mapping visuals

Sky's the limit. I'll have to choose something simple and then move forward.
