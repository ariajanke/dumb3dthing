# Dumb 3D Project
I'm just dumping this online, for backup/version control purposes. It's GPLv3.
If you find use for any of this, great. This is not intended as a readable/
usable project. It's just for fun. n.n

## Current "tickets"
- composite maps
- bug hunting
- better camera
- loop-de-loops
- other game entities
- other game play goodies
- water
- other mapping visuals

Sky's the limit. I'll have to choose something simple and then move forward.
